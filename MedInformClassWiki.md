# Medical Informatics Curriculum for Udemy Course(s)

##Background:
see [Background and motivation](http://www.crunches-data.appspot.com/blog3.html) for the course. 
The central premise is a need for an informatics offering with a medical perspective primarily and in information technology perspective secondarily - to serve medical practitioners and administrators. The intent is to provide the necessary setting for physicians and other medical and paramedical practitioners to effect the development of their information tools directly.

##Overview:
The course divides naturally into several parts: 
* **Biomedical Knowledge in an information system context**. An overview of medical data and information and how it would fits into, or is adapted to an information systems paradigm. 
* **General Informatics knowledge**. Information systems tools, both hardware and software. System and tool development as it relates to the medical information and knowledge domain. 
* **Data Analysis Principles**. The statistical basis of aggregated information in the generation of new clinical knowledge knowledge. The epidemiological, community and public health principles at play in the analysis of data and the assessment of medical knowledge in new contexts.
* **Systems and Organizational knowledge** upon which design and development of information and knowledge tools is based.
* **Management Principles** as they relate to the governance, strategy, administration and on going maintenance of data storage, the clinical tools and knowledge sharing of clinical medical systems. Essential knowledge for the active participation of clinicians in the operations of Medical Information technology

##Curriculum:
The starting model for this curriculum is the content described in "Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Family Medicine Residents: Medical Informatics" [AAFP Reprint No. 288](http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/documents/medical_education_residency/program_directors/Reprint288_Informatics.pdf). Off necessity, the media involved are narrower than the Guidelines which are described in the context of a residency program including more than a didactic format:

>Curriculum implementation should include both focused and longitudinal experience throughout the residency program. Didactic lectures and journal clubs should be augmented with instruction regarding principles of the doctor-patient-computer relationship in daily practice . . . (AAFP)

The model is built upon to enhance content and provide for the needs of practicing clinicians after their residency. Again, based upon the framework of the AAFP Guidelines the core Curriculum consists of:
